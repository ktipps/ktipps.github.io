        <!--Problem and Solution-->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>Algorithms carry an inherent risk. They aren’t created in a vacuum, and the developers making them or the data sets leveraged for training these models can bring intermixed bias. 
                    <br><br>At its worst, this bias can be racist or discriminate against specific gender or sexual identities, making the difference in how a teenager perceives themselves or whether a woman gets hired.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                <p>Given the stakes, our team wanted to figure out how to educate & empower users to report the bias they encounter in order to make Facebook a safer place. 
                    <br><br> That's why we created Facebook Bias Bot. Facebook bias bot is a chat feature where users can pose questions about algorithmic bias they encounter
                     and receive clear feedback.

            <div class="col-sm-9">
            <h4>Targeting Active Social Media Users</h4>
            <p>We choose to focus on active Facebook users who frequently use the platform, but are also active on other social media sites as well, in order to get a sense of people's opinions on other platforms' approaches to algorithmic bias.

            <h4>Key Insights from the Research</h4>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h5>Increased Feedback on Reports</h5>
                <p>Our research showed no one wanted to wonder where their report went and what will be done with it. Users wanted feedback on the impact on their report to avoid feeling like a 'drop in the bucket.'
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h5>Clear Definition of Algorithmic Bias</h5>
                <p>Most people I spoke to had trouble actually defining what constituted algorithmic bias or giving examples. 
                    This demonstrated a need to give clear definitions of what algorithmic bias is in practice.
                  </p>
            </div>

         <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5>Motivating Users to Take Action</h5>
                <p>People felt motivated to report algorithmic bias only when they are personally offended or a community they care about is impacted.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <br><br>
                <h5>Feature Discoverability</h5>
                <p> If the feature wasn't easy to discover, user interest dramatically declined. Users enjoy being ingrained in the flow of their social media consumption and
                    don't want to disrupt their experience with having to exit the platform.

            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <p>   <br><br>As our research showed, most people need clear definitions of what consistutes algorithmic bias. 
                    <br><br> This feature would allow users to pose scenarios they face in a safe environment, and the bot would use predetermined guidelines and question series
                    to answer their questions. It could also recommend helpful articles based on keywords in the user's responses.
                    <br><br>We choose an automatic bot because customer service reps would be immensely expensive for a platform with a large user base like Facebook, which also has time zone differences for its users.

        <!--Next Steps / Implications-->
        <div class="subsequentRow row">
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <h4>Final Thoughts & Implications</h4>
                <p> We imagine Facebook Bias Bot would be one feature in a social media environment on Facebook. In this environment, we imagine users could track a ticket about their report, see its status, and receive opt-in, sporadic updates about how many people reported similar content.
                    <br><br>Due to the project requirements, we were not able to enter the prototyping and evaluative research phases of this project. If given more time, I would have loved to prototype and further test these concepts.
